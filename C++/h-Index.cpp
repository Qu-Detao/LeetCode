/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h 
of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have 
no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers 
in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the 
researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no 
more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:
1. An easy approach is to sort the array first.
2. What are the possible values of h-index?
3. A faster approach is to use extra space.
